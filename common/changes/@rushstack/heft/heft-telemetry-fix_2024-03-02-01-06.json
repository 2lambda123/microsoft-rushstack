      "comment": "Add new metrics value `bootDurationMs` to track the boot overhead of Heft before the action starts executing the subtasks. Update the start time used to compute `taskTotalExecutionMs` to be the beginning of operation graph execution. Fix the value of `taskTotalExecutionMs` field to be in milliseconds instead of seconds. Add new metrics value `totalUptimeMs` to track how long watch mode sessions are kept alive.",
