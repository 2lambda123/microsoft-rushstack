An additional command line action `rush analyze` was added to do analysis on the enriched telemetry data. `rush analyze —dependency-analysis` and `rush analyze —simulate` were. —dependency-analysis uses the build times to identify which projects in the build are choke points where reducing the build time of these projects by 1 second will reduce the overall build time by 1 second. —simulate uses the build times to identify the optimal number of CPu cores to build your project with.",
