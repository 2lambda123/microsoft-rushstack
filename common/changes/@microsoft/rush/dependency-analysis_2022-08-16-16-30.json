      "comment": "Added dependency analysis by enriching the telemetry data and two additional rush build flags: --analysis and --simulate. Both flags require the additional --file flag that will point to the telemetry file that has been written to the telemetry folder. --analysis uses the build times to identify which projects in the build are choke points where reducing the build time of these projects by 1 second will reduce the overall build time by 1 second. --simulate uses the build times to identify the optimal number of CPU cores to build your project with.",
