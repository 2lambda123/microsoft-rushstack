This is a code sample for [API Extractor](http://aka.ms/extractor), which creates a simple
online API reference manual for your TypeScript library.  It reads *.api.json data files
produced by API Extractor, and creates web pages using the
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file format.
